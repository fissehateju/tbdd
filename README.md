# TBDD (Territory-based Data Dissemination for Mobile Sink Wireless Sensor Networks) Simulator

This simulator is developed to evaluate TBDD. It has a graphical user interface that provides details of simulations execution and other pieces of information. 

Developed by Fisseha Teju Wedaj et al. (<a href="mailto:fishteju@mail.ustc.edu.cn">fishteju@mail.ustc.edu.cn</a>)

## Implementation 
The main windows graphical user interface (GUI) designs and implementations can be found at: [https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/ui](https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/ui). The Cells, spanning tree and Regions constructions are the backbones of this protocol, and they are located at: [https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Constructor](https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Constructor). Sensor nodes are given roles depending on their location. The role designation implemented at: [https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Models/Cell](https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Models/Cell). The mobility model for the mobile sink can be found at: [https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Models/MobileModel](https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Models/MobileModel). Finally, the data routing illustration implemented at: [https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Dataplane](https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/tree/main/Dataplane), while Region's information broadcasting is implemented at: [https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/blob/main/Region/ActiveRegBeacon.cs](https://github.com/fissehateju/tbdd/blob/main/Region/ActiveRegBeacon.cs)
